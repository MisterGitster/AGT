		Hi everyone.  Thanks for visiting my site!  
	</p>

	<p>
		Let me state up front...I'm not a music major, but I love playing guitar. Not everything you find on here will be transcribed EXACTLY as the original...the same song can be played a 100 different ways, but it should be close!  If you have a tab that you think is worth posting, and you'd like to share it, send it my way!  I will post them as I am able to.  	
	</p>

	<p>
		Questions or comments send me an email!
	</p>

	<p>
		Peace and hair grease.
